'''Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. 
So, the first few numbers in the Fibonacci series look like this:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

Each number in the series (starting from the third number) is the sum of the two numbers immediately before it.
 For example, 2 is the sum of 1 and 1, 3 is the sum of 1 and 2, 5 is the sum of 2 and 3, and so on. 
 This pattern continues indefinitely, creating a unique sequence of numbers with many interesting mathematical properties.'''
